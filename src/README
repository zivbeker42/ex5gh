filters package:
Filterable - an interface describing what each filter class must implement.
allFilter - A class implementing a filters which accepts all files.
numbersFilter - A class implementing a filter that is described by a lower bound and/or an upper bound of the
file size.
permissionFilter - A filter responsible for filters of type writable, executable, hidden.
stringFilter - A class implementing a filter that is described by a string checking the file's name. Meaning
it is responsible for file, contains, prefix, suffix filter.
negateFilter - filter which negates any other filter.

=  Implementation details   =
=============================
OpenHashSet: I implemented it as an array of linked list(wrapper)s.
ClosedHashSet Deletion: I used a StringWrapper class which delegates a string and can change the state
						of this string to selected or not. in this way there are no nulls in the hash table
						and i can recognize between a deleted cell a taken cell or a cell that hasn"t been
						used at all.
Warm Up Phase: 200 iterations.

Results discussion
=============================
1. Bad results for data1.txt:   OpenHashSet:    When you enter values with the same hashcode it effectively
                                                turns into a list and inserting items in an O(1) runtime.
                                ClosedHashSet:  When you enter values with the same hashcode it has to iterate
                                                for a long time to find values that were entered late (O(size)
                                                 complexity).
2.  OpenHashSet     Strengths: easily inserting values.
                    Weaknesses: having trouble with finding elements that have a lot of other elements with
                    the same hash code.
                    Where I would use it: Sets with evenly distributed hash values.
    ClosedHashSet   Strengths: easily finds and inserts elements with evenly distributed hash values
                    Weaknesses: finding and inserting elements with the same hash values as a lot of others.
                    Where I would use it: Sets with evenly distributed hash values
    TreeSet         Strengths: Adding elements with the same hash code.
                    Weaknesses: Adding elements with evenly distributed hash values.
                    Where I would use it: When I need to find and search many values when there are a lot of
                    items with the same hash code.
    LinkedList      Strengths: should add elements very easily (but I don"t see this in my results)
                    Weaknesses: finding elements.
                    Where I would use it: when I need to add and remove items in a LIFO way.
    HashSet         Strengths: practically everything
                    Weaknesses: couldn't find any
                    Where I would use it: Always (when the operations I need are add and contains, of course)

3. OpenHashSet vs ClosedHashSet: Close was better in most "contains" operations (especially on data 2),
                                 insertion data 1 was easier for Open and Close was faster with data 2.
4. Java HashSet vs my HashSets: Java's was better by a very large factor almost every test.
5. I was expecting for this results actually but I was surprised by the time it would for my hashsets to do
the given actions( I thought it would take much less time) and by time hashset did all of the actions.
6. Java HashSet performance: I expected the hash set to be better than else but not by this big difference.
7. I used only one clamping method as explained in the exercise.
